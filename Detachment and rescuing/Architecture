In this scenario the most suitable architecture would be the component based architecture because it offers many advantages
- Each part of the robot will be considered as unique, offering different interfaces, coding languages (if required), functionnality and thus offer ease in maintenance
- There is collaboration between objects
   In our case as it's implemented in collaborative way, the component manager will allow the component loader to launch each component dpending on if the other components
   are already working or not, hence it's already important to think about concurrency and thus threads.
